In this THM room, we learn how to spot phishing emails from Mahare's Eggsploit Bunnies
sent to The Big Festive Company (TBFC) users. [^1]

Classify the 1st email, what's the flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
phishing
impersonation
fake invoice
side channel communication attempt
sense of urgency

Classify the 2nd email, what's the flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Classify the 3rd email, what's the flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This email titled "URGENT: McSkidy VPN access for incident response" immediately strikes
to be a *phishing* email due to its *sense of urgency* and *impersonation* as McSkidy, it
is however very unlikely, that the real McSkidy would choose the complicated email
address "mcskiddyy202512[@]gmail[.]com" from a public domain. Further, upon reading the
content of the email, we suspect a *social engineering text* without many internal hints
towards any connection to the company since the "Team" addressing and the name of the
"Blue Team" department is very generic too. This email was created without much attention
to detail, yet, it can be effective on few victims in a large group of recipients since
humans are usually likely to help, especially if it comes from one of their co-workers
and it involves an urgent accident with a (somewhat) believable story.

Classify the 4th email, what's the flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classify the 5th email, what's the flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This email titled "Improve you event logistics this SOC-mas season" can be classified as
a *spam* email since it urges its recipients towars engagement in promotion. Here, we can
see a marketing email offering logistics solutions with a valid sender address and no
pressing urgency towards clicking on any external links.

Classify the 6th email, what's the flag?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"tbfc-it[@]tbƒc[.]com"
*typosquatting or punnycodes*
*impersonation*
*social engineer text*
