In this THM room, we unleash the power of AI by exploring it's uses within cyber
security. [^1] We explore the features of AI for processing large amounts of data,
behaviour analysis (for defensive security) and generative AI (for offensive security).

Complete the AI showcase by progressing through all of the stages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon visiting the target machines' IP address in the web browser, we can complete the
showcase stages on the Van SolveIT AI assistant. In the beginning, we discover how AI can
be used to generate scripts to exploit vulnerabilities, as part of *Red Team* tasks.

Next, we see how AI can be used to analyse logs, as part of *Blue Team* tasks.

Finally, we harness the power of AI to review source code and identify how vulnerabilites
are introduced, as part of *Software Security*.

Execute the exploit against the vulnerable web application to get the flag.
