This THM challenge, is a beginner-friendly CTF featuring six unique scenarios, starting
from quick warmups and classic SOC investigations, escalating to cases that push well
beyond the typical L1 role. [^1]

[Task 3] Probably Just Fine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the first task, we want to investigate the following alert on the SOC dashboard. The
SOC handover notes did mention, that Susan is going to attend a conference in Singapore
but according to the SOC procedure, we still want to verify each IP address. Thus, we
find out that the IP looks suspicious indeed, and upon contacting Susan, we find out that
she did not log in to the company VPN. While using a public WiFi hotspot at a café, she
was however prompted to install a "security check" tool, which she did.

> Unusual VPN login of susan.martin[@]probablyfine[.]thm from 37[.]19[.]201[.]132
> (Singapore) and a suspicious binary with the hash
> b8e02f2bc0ffb42e8cf28e37a26d8d825f639079bf6d948f8debab6440ee5630.

For this, we are given a threat intelligence database, similar to VirusTotal to check the
reputation and other details of IP addresses, domains and file hashes. The host telemetry
further reveals a suspicious binary with the hash.

### What is the ASN number related to the IP?
First, we run a lookup scan of the IP address with `whois <IP_ADDRESS>` to get the 
*Autonomous System Number* (ASN) number in the origin information. And indeed, we thus
discover the AS followed by the number that we can enter for this task.

### Which service is offered from this IP?
From simply reading the introduction to this task, we are informed what service is
offered from this IP address.

### What is the filename of the file related to the hash?
This task requires us to copy the filehash from the introduction and paste it into the
search bar of *TryDetectThis 2.0* [^2] and from this public knowledge, we can now see the
file name as it is listed under the basic properties.

### What is the threat signature that Microsoft assigned to the file?
Under the *Vendor Analysis* there is also *Microsoft* listed as a vendor and under the
detection name, we can discover the threat signature.

### Based on its HTTPS certificate, how many domains are linked to the same campaign?
One of the contacted domains is part of a large malicious infrastructure cluster. From
the list of contacted domains that the file is communicating with, there are a few that
stand out to be a possible C2 endpoint, payload delivery or secondary redirect. So, we
start by analyzing the domain `gadgethgfub[.]icu` in our custom VirusTotal instance. And
under the HTTPS Certificate Data, we can click on the latest certificate with a whole
list of alternative names, as can be seen in `subject_alternative_names.txt`. The total
amount of alternative names equals the count of domains that are linked to this very same
campaign for this task.

### What line is present in the YARA rule's "condition" field by "kevoreilly"?
For the file hash, there is one YARA rule "Lumma Payload" from the author "kevoreilly".
We further investigate this rule in the GitHub page [^3] and present it below together
with the condition field:
```
rule Lumma {
  meta:
    author = "kevoreilly"
    description = "Lumma Payload"
    cape_type = "Lumma Payload"
    packed = "0ee580f0127b821f4f1e7c032cf76475df9724a9fade2e153a69849f652045f8"
    packed = "23ff1c20b16d9afaf1ce443784fc9a025434a010e2194de9dec041788c369887"
  strings:
    $decode1 = {C1 (E9|EA) 02 [0-3] 0F B6 (44|4C) ?? FF 83 (F8|F9) 3D 74 05 83 (F8|F9) 2E 75 01 (49|4A) [0-30] 2E 75}
    $decode2 = {B0 40 C3 B0 3F C3 89 C8 04 D0 3C 09 77 06 80 C1 04 89 C8 C3 89 C8 04 BF 3C}
    $decode3 = {B0 40 C3 B0 3F C3 80 F9 30 72 ?? 80 F9 39 77 06 80 C1 04 89 C8 C3}
    $decode4 = {89 C8 04 D0 3C 09 77 ?? [3-11] 89 C8 [0-1] C3 89 C8 04 BF 3C 1A 72 ?? 89 C8 04 9F 3C}
  condition:
    uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and any of them
}
```

### What is the title of the TI report mentioning this hash?
In the *Detections and Reports* tab of TryDetectThis 2.0, we can discover the report [^4]
that presents the Lumma infostealer threat analysis. This report analyzes in detail, how
Lumma operates as part of a decentralized cybercrime ecosystem, showing a wide range of
tools and underground services to steal credentials, evade detection, run multiple scams,
and monetize stolen data.

### Which team did the author of the malware start collaborating with in early 2024?
By reading the report, we find out the crucial information on the team, that Lumma began
collaborating with in early 2024. This affiliated SOCKS5 proxies from infected bots, as
the team provided a residential proxy plugin.

### Which mentioned infostealer targets Android systems?
A Mexican-based affiliate related to the malware family also uses other infostealers.
Following the use of additional infostealers alongside Lumma in the article, we also
discover an Android-based *Remote Access Trojan* (RAT), based on Telegram profile images
likely tied to the affiliate.

### Which MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique does this align with?
The report states that the affiliates behind the malware use the services of AnonRDP. In
the *Appendix C - MITRE ATT&CK Techniques*, we discover a listing of techniques and their
matching ATT&CK code. Since this service focuses on VPN's we choose the *Acquire
Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server* sub-tactic to be best aligned with the described
attack on "Probably Just Fine".

[Task 4] Phishing Books
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the second task, we are in charge of monitoring alerts from universities in London
through our SOC dashboard. Then, we get an email from a university teacher, that raises
our interest.

> Subject: MFA Removal Requests<br>
> From: Dr. Isabella <isabella[@]kingford[.]ac[.]uk><br><br>
> Hey, ProbablyFine SOC Team,<br>
> I've been getting several emails asking me to approve my MFA.<br>
> Are you performing any tests? Should I approve these requests?<br>
> Dr. Isabella

So, we immediately contact Dr. Isabella, as it is clear she has been targeted in a
phishing campaign. Further, we want to investigate the original `.eml` file to find out
if this was an isolated hit, or part of a larger scheme targeting universities.

### Which specific check within the headers explains the bypass of email filters?
First, we check the *arch-authentication-results* to check whether any of the following
headers are marked as failed or none, indicating an authentication failure. And indeed,
all three of them are marked as none, i.e. `dkim=none, spf=none, dmarc=none`. Out of the
three signatures, there is one that should be considered for this task, because it does
not to specify how email receivers should handle emails that fail authentication.

### What technique did the attacker use to make the message seem legitimate?
The attacker's domain `kinglord[.]ac[.]uk` is very similar to the legitimate domain
`kingford[.]ac[.]uk`. Further, we discover in the email, that the sender's domain
`thelondouniversity[.]ac[.]uk` is just missing an *n* before *university* to be exactly
the legitimate email domain `thelondonuniversity[.]ac[.]uk`. The solution to this task
is the technique that describes the registration of a lookalike domain to fool a victim
into believing the message is from a legitimate source.

### Which MITRE technique and sub-technique ID best fit this sender address trick?
For this, we enter "MITRE Technique" followed by the previous solution in the search bar
of a search engine of our choice and thus get prompted with the code, that describes how
adversaries may acquire domains that can be used during targeting. Adversaries may choose
domains that are similar to legitimate domains, including through use of homoglyphs or
use of a different *Top-Level Domain* (TLD). [^5]

### What is the file extension of the attached file?
By importing the phishing email into the mail application *Evolution*, we can download
the potentially malicious attachment and log the file extension for this task.

### What is the MD5 hash of the .HTML file?
In the *EML-Analysis-Report.html* we can scroll down to attachments and have a look at
the investigation key and values. Here, we can search the MD5 hash in VirusTotal which is
also the answer for this task. Alternatively, we can also run the command `md5sum` on the
*library-invoice.pdf.html* attachment to get the MD5 hash.

### What is the landing page of the phishing attack?
After the static analysis of the attack, we can now move on to the dynamic analysis in
a controlled environment, i.e. virtual machine. Therefore, we open the phishing HTML page
*library-invoice.pdf.html* and log the landing page's URL.

### Which MITRE technique ID was used inside the attached file?
Upon opening the attached file in a text editor, we discover an unknown type of
JavaScript obfuscation for the variables `xanthium` and `egassem`. So, we google for the
MITRE technique ID for obfuscated files or information and discover one with 17
sub-techniques. Here, the description "adversaries may attempt to make an exectuable or
file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating
its contents on the system or transit" [^6] is fitting perfectly to what the attackers
did here.

### What is the hidden message the attacker left in the file?
From the previous task already, we discovered some variables with obfuscated content and
now we aim for its decryption to find out the hidden message.
```
var xanthium = [
  "\u0032\u0038\u0030\u0038\u003a",              
  "\u006d\u006f\u0063\u002e",                          
  "\u0032\u0033\u0034\u0032\u0033\u0065\u0077\u0063\u0033\u0031\u002d",
  "\u0075\u006c\u0074\u0079\u0072\u0061\u0072\u0062\u0069\u0456\u006c", 
  "\u002f\u002f\u003a\u0070\u0074\u0074\u0068"              
];
var egassem = [
  "\u005e\u005e\u0020\u0073\u0065\u0069\u0072\u0061\u0072",
  "\u0062\u0069\u006c\u0020\u006d\u006f\u0072\u0066\u0020",
  "\u0073\u006b\u006f\u006f\u0062\u0020\u0068\u0073",
  "\u0069\u0068\u0070\u0020\u006f\u0074\u0020",
  "\u0065\u0076\u006f\u006c\u0020\u0049"      
];
```
In the `deobfuscated_variables.js` file we now provide the steps to decrypt the content
of the `xanthium` and `egassem` variables.
