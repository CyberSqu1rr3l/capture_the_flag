Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains write-ups for a variety of *Capture The Flag* (CTF) challenges
and wargames, tackling problems across multiple domains of cybersecurity and computer
engineering. Each write-up provides a detailed solution to the challenge, breaking down
the steps taken and the tools used. The objective of this project is not only to document
solutions for future reference but also to share knowledge and techniques with others who
are passionate about learning and improving their skills in the field of cybersecurity.

Repository Structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- `crypto_hack`: This platform teaches cryptography through a series of puzzles that
  teach small lessons and motivate further research. The website creators ask not to
  publish solutions or writeups outside of the platform. Therefore, we publish results
  unlisted with the "Solutions" link as it appears next to the challenge.
  [Visit my profile @cybersquirrel on Crypto Hack](https://cryptohack.org/user/cybersquirrel/) [^6]
- `hack_the_box`: The online platform that offers a variety of cybersecurity challenges,
  virtual labs, and educational resources. This folder contains writeups for rooms in HTB
  Academy, challenges in HTB Labs and events in HTB CTF.
  [Visit my profile @CyberSqu1rr3l on Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/1682336) [^7]
- `mystery_twister`: Serves a collection of solutions for riddles from the cipher
  challenge contest platform. Discover my profile @cybersquirrel on MysteryTwister. [^8]
- `root_me`: This folder contains my writeups for challenges and "CTF all the day"
  virtual environments that can be found in the hacking and infosec learning platform.
  [Visit my profile @cybersquirrel on Root Me](https://www.root-me.org/cybersquirrel) [^5]
- `try_hack_me`: The interactive gamified learning platform for learning cybersecurity
  concepts through hands-on challenges and real-world simulations.
